I am an assistant research professor in University of Michigan. 
My research interests are self-driving cars and AI safety. 

I am leading the AV safety project in [Mcity](https://mcity.umich.edu), and leading the DARPA Challenge for transferable agents [TIAMAT](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/transfer-from-imprecise).

Welcome to use our developed self-driving planning toolchains, [SPIDER](https://github.com/Thu-ADLab/SPIDER).

Welcome any coffee chat in Ann Arbor or discussions on my research topics.
