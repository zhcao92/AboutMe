My passion is to achieve real safe and trustworthy L4 autonomous vehicles, by developing powerful data-driven algorithms.
Research topics focus on out-of-distribution risk constrains in ML algorithms and practical reinforcement learning or continual learning algoriths for self-driving decision-making.

Currently, I am a research scientist in School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University.
I received my B.S. and Ph.D. from Tsinghua University in 2015 and 2020, respectively. 
I also worked as a research assistant in [Mcity](https://mcity.umich.edu) at the University of Michigan.
